    <p>
        Music finds itself at the center of cultures worldwide, serving as a universal language that can transcend boundaries.  It has the unique ability to evoke powerful emotions in those who engage with it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Music can make you feel melancholy from listening to something like Deftones's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPpDyIJdasg">'Change (In the House of Flies)'</a>, or full of energy from listening to Metallica's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ozmU9cJDg">'Master of Puppets'</a>. Yet, you wouldn’t understand that feeling if you’ve never connected with the world of music and it can be overwhelming with the amount of material that is out there.
    </p>
    <p>
        What genre and time period would be a good <b>starting place</b> for you looking to start listening to music?
    </p>

    
    

    <img width="25%" src="webpage-images/Rolling_Stone_logo.png" alt="Rolling Stone Magazine Logo">
    <p>
        Since there is so much music out in the world, I have to narrow it down somehow. I decided to narrow my view to Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the top 500 albums of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because they are a respected music publication, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take them up on their recommendations 
    </p>
    <p>
        From here, I tried to find the <b>most common genre</b> and <b>time period</b> of the albums in the list to find a concrete starting place for new music listeners.
    </p>

    <h1>So What Did the List Look Like?</h1>
    
    <p>
        As you can see in the bar graph below, <b>Rock was absolutely the most common genre</b>, and it's not even close. <b>316</b> of the albums in the list were Rock, with the runner-ups Funk/Soul and Electronic only occupying 50 and 44 spaces respectively.
    </p>

    <div id="chart" style="float: left;"></div>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    <div id="image-container" style="float: left; margin-left: 5px;"></div>

    <p>The graph below displays how many albums in the list were released during a certain time period.</p>
    <p>As you can see, most of them were released between <b>1960 and 1980</b>.</p>
    
    <img src="time-period-histogram.png" style="display: block;" alt="time period histogram">

    <p>It is also worth noting that an average of two different subgenres apply to albums within the list, which gives you opportunity to explore different sounds that you may end up liking.</p>
    <p>Because of all of this information, I think we have a solid starting point if you want to start listening to music.</p>

    <h1>The Starting Point</h1>
    <p>
        A great starting point for a new music listener would be <b>Rock music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s</b>. Below I have listed 3 different albums that are worth checking out but don't feel limited those albums, feel free to check out any Rock album from that period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe even create playlists for songs that you end up enjoying.
    </p>
     <p>
        Once you start listening to a few albums, begin exploring the subgenres that each album has to offer, whether it be rebellious Punk, or mind-bending Psychedelic rock.  
     </p>
     <p>    
        So embark on this journey, immerse yourself in the array of sounds, giving you a deeper appreciation for creativity and expression, and discovering the vast spectrum of music that the world has to offer.
